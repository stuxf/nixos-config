My config. It is what it is. Work in progress!

Decided to try Nix after my friend @airwuu hopped on it a couple months ago.

Most of the config so far is from https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/.

## Non-declaratively set things

Not everything is declaratively set via my config. Here is a small (likely non-inclusive list). Some of these are intentional, others are not, and some I intend to get to when I have more time.

- Discord settings
- Web browser login details
- Bitwarden being pinned in firefox
- Extensions enabled in private windows firefox
